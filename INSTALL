Building IsoStuffer
---------------------------------------

This tool is built using CMake. Building has been tested on both Linux and Mac OSX. 
Both Gnu C++ compiler (g++) and Intel C++ compiler (icpc) have been tested for 
compiling the source code. 

Requirements
============

The following libraries are required
  
    * CMake (v2.4+)
    * Boost (v1.33+)
    * libQGLViewer (v2.3.8+)
    * QT4 (v4.4+)

Building
============
1. Create a new directory to ensure noting affected in the source directory

   mkdir gcc-build
   cd gcc-build

2. Configure the compile using CMake
   
   cmake .. 
   or
   ccmake ..
   or 
   cmake-gui ..

   For better performance, enabling OpenMP is suggested. OpenMP support can be turned on
   using USE_OPENMP option, i.e.
   
   cmake -DUSE_OPENMP=ON ..
    
   NOTE: If you install libQGLViewer in local dir, say $HOME/local, you can specify its 
   location by
   cmake -DQGLViewer_DIR=$HOME/local ..

3. Compile the code

   make 

4. After compiling the code successfully, executables are in gcc-build/src directory.
